# earthmc-dynmap+
This extension customizes the EarthMC's dynamic map website with various features such as colored meganations and alliances, better statistics and more.

## Updates
Alliances/meganations data is based on EMC Toolkit database, which their team accepts requests on their [discord](https://discord.gg/AVtgkcRgFs).

## Download and use
The extension can be added on Firefox and on most, if not all Chromium-based browsers, those include Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome and Opera. Here is how it can be installed:

### Chromium (Edge, Chrome, Opera)
1. Download the latest 'chromium.zip' asset from [the release page](https://github.com/3meraldK/earthmc-dynmapcolor/releases).
2. Unpack the downloaded file, and head to your browser; go to your extensions manager.
3. Turn on developer mode and load unpacked folder. You can disable the mode afterwards.

### Firefox
1. Download the latest 'firefox.zip' asset from [the release page](https://github.com/3meraldK/earthmc-dynmapcolor/releases).
2. Now, you can choose two browsers; Firefox allows for one-time use per session, i.e. it will be removed after you close the browser - that is because the plugin is unsigned. [Mozilla Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer) however will pernamently keep its add-ons on the list.
3. In the normal edition, search "about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox" and then load an add-on via the button, by selecting the file.
4. In the developer edition, search "about:config", then search "xpinstall.signatures.required" and set it to false. Restart the browser, search "about:addons" and import the add-on from the asset. Make sure it has been installed because sometimes it might not.
