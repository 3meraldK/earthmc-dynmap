# earthmc-dynmapcolor
Colors meganations on the map and more. This project is a remake of https://github.com/FranchuFranchu/emc-dynmap-colors, but removes all star markers and solidifies the towns' strokes. Right now it's supported only on Mozilla Firefox.

# Download and use
1. Download the 'extension.zip' asset from https://github.com/3meraldK/earthmc-dynmapcolor/releases.
2. In the normal browser, search "about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox" and then load an add-on via the button, by selecting the file. The add-on will be usable on a one browser session meaning that you have to repeat this step every time you reopen the browser. This is an unsigned plugin.
3. However if you want to permanently install the extension, you may use the Firefox Developer Edition browser.
    1. Search "about:config", accept the prompt and search for 'xpinstall.signatures.required' and toggle the value to false.
    2. Restart the browser.
    3. Search "about:addons" and import the add-on from the file.
