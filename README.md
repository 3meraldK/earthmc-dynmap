# earthmc-dynmap+
This Firefox extension enriches the EarthMC dynmap with various features, such as coloring meganations and alliances the same color, beautifying elements of the site and more.

## Updates
Alliances data is based on EMC Toolkit database, which their team accepts requests on their [discord](https://discord.gg/AVtgkcRgFs).

## Download and use
This plugin is supported only on Firefox due to Chromium limitations, however you may use [this userscript](https://github.com/32Vache/emc-map-colors) on Chromium browsers (MS Edge, Chrome, Opera, Brave). Installation course for Mozilla:

1. Download the latest 'extension.zip' asset from [the release page](https://github.com/3meraldK/earthmc-dynmapcolor/releases).
2. Now, you can choose two browsers; Firefox allows for one-time use per session, i.e. it will be removed after you close the browser - that is because the plugin is unsigned. [Mozilla Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer) however will pernamently keep its add-ons on the list.
3. In the normal edition, search "about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox" and then load an add-on via the button, by selecting the file.
4. In the developer edition, search "about:config", then search "xpinstall.signatures.required" and set it to false. Restart the browser, search "about:addons" and import the add-on from the asset. Make sure it has been installed because sometimes it might not.
