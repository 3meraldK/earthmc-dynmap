# earthmc-dynmapcolor
Colors meganations on the map and more. This project is a remake of https://github.com/FranchuFranchu/emc-dynmap-colors, but removes all star markers and solidifies the towns' strokes. Right now it's supported only on Mozilla Firefox.

# Download and use
1. Download 'extension.zip' file on the local machine. It can be done by entering https://github.com/3meraldK/earthmc-dynmapcolor/blob/main/extension.zip and clicking 'View raw' or the download button.
2. In the normal browser, search "about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox" and then load a temporary add-on, by selecting the file. The add-on will be usable on a one browser session meaning that you have to repeat this step everytime you reopen the browser. This is an unsigned plugin.
3. However if you want to permanently install the extension, you may use Firefox Developer Edition browser.
    1. Search "about:config", accept the prompt and search for 'xpinstall.signatures.required' and toggle the value to false.
    2. Restart the browser.
    3. Search "about:addons" and import the add-on from the file.
