# earthmc-dynmap+
A web extension for Chromium and Gecko. Designed specifically for EarthMC's dynamic map, with great multitude of useful and cosmetic features.

## Features
When creating the WebExtension, the main idea was to connect the countries on the map into their respective organizations and "meganations". Later on, in the natural course of things, the number of new features began to grow with new releases.
* Three map modes to switch between: alliances, meganations, default
* Archive mode to view old claims and statistics. (from the Wayback Machine)
* Search towns and nations by name
* Total revamp of the aesthetics
* More information about player or town, in one click
* Much more! It's regularly updated with new stuff you'll like.

We don't work alone! We cooperate with EMC Toolkit (developers of EarthMC Stats and more), which provide latest alliances data. You can help by registering a new alliance, or requesting a change. [Click here to join.]](https://discord.gg/AVtgkcRgFs)

## Installation
### Chromium-based (Chrome, Opera, Edge, Brave)
1. Download the latest 'chromium.zip' asset from [the release page](https://github.com/3meraldK/earthmc-dynmapcolor/releases).
2. Unpack the file and head to your browser; go to your extensions manager.
3. Turn on developer mode and load the unpacked folder. It's recommended to keep the directory somewhere.

### Gecko-based (Firefox, LibraWolf)
1. Download the latest 'firefox.zip' asset from [the release page](https://github.com/3meraldK/earthmc-dynmapcolor/releases).
2. Go to the debugging section (for most browsers: 'about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox') and load temporary add-on.
3. Repeat the last step everytime you open browser and want to use the extension. It is unfortunately that way, because the add-on is unsigned, yet. 
a. Note: [Mozilla Nightly](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer) allows for the installation in 'about:addons'.
b. In this case, go to 'about:config' and set 'xpinstall.signatures.required' to false.
c. Go to 'about:addons' and 'Install add-on from file'.
