# earthmc-dynmapcolor
This Mozilla Firefox add-on enriches the EarthMC dynmap with the meganation support, i.e. now colors entire meganations/alliances the same color, and more. 

## Updates
Meganation data should be maintained regularly. If you govern the meganation or alliance, and want to modify it, please contact the owner through Discord by the name 3meraldK#2137.

# Download and use
This plugin is supported only on Mozilla Firefox due to Chromium limitations, however you may use [this userscript](https://github.com/32Vache/emc-map-colors) on Chromium browsers (MS Edge, Chrome, Opera, Brave). Installation course:

1. Download the latest 'extension.zip' asset from [the release page](https://github.com/3meraldK/earthmc-dynmapcolor/releases).
2. In the normal browser, search "about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox" and then load an add-on via the button, by selecting the file. The add-on will be usable on a one browser session meaning that you have to repeat this step every time you reopen the browser. That is because it will likely be unsigned plugin.
3. However if you want to permanently install the extension, you may use the Firefox Developer Edition browser.
    1. Search "about:config", accept the prompt and search for 'xpinstall.signatures.required' and toggle the value to false.
    2. Restart the browser.
    3. Search "about:addons" and import the add-on from the file.
