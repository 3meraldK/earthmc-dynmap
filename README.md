# earthmc-dynmap+
A web extension for Chromium and Gecko. Designed specifically for EarthMC's dynamic map, with great multitude of useful and cosmetic features.

## Features
When creating the WebExtension, the main idea was to connect the countries on the map into their respective organizations and "meganations". Later on, in the natural course of things, the number of new features began to grow with new releases.
* Three map modes to switch between: alliances, meganations, default
* Archive mode to view old claims and statistics. (from the Wayback Machine)
* Search towns and nations by name
* Total revamp of the aesthetics
* Notifications about new releases
* More information about players or towns, in one click (to view player's information, click the username on map)
* Much more! It's regularly updated with new stuff you'll like

We don't work alone! We cooperate with EMC Toolkit (developers of EarthMC Stats and more), which provide latest alliances data. You can help by registering a new alliance, or requesting a change. [Click here to join.](https://discord.gg/AVtgkcRgFs) 

## Installation
### Chromium-based (Chrome, Opera, Edge, Brave)
1. Download the latest "chromium.zip" asset from [the release page](https://github.com/3meraldK/earthmc-dynmapcolor/releases/latest).
2. Unpack/unzip the file's contents. If you use context menu, don't click "Unpack to chromium/"!
3. Go to your browser's extensions manager and turn on developer mode (it's mandatory, because the add-on is unsigned).
4. Click "Load the unpacked/unzipped folder". It's recommended to keep the directory somewhere, otherwise you will have to reinstall extension.

### Gecko-based (Firefox, LibraWolf)
1. Download the latest "firefox.zip" asset from [the release page](https://github.com/3meraldK/earthmc-dynmapcolor/releases/latest).
2. Go to the debugging page (for most browsers: "about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox").
3. Click "Load temporary add-on" and select downloaded file.
4. Repeat two last steps everytime you open browser and want to use the extension. It is unfortunately that way, because the add-on is unsigned, yet.
> Note: [Mozilla Nightly](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer) allows for the permanent installation in "about:addons". In this release, head to "about:config" and set "xpinstall.signatures.required" to false. Then go to "about:addons". Click the gearwheel and then "Install add-on from file".
